# EvolvingNames
an evolution simulator of letters into Strings

the program has a set target that will only end once the letters evolve into perfectly. The program has a list of all the English characters (including space and “-“)

the Genome.java file manages how the characters mutate, breed, and evolve.

The population.java file controls the breeding cycle, calling the genome class to populate, and how fit some strings are and keeps an upper percentile to continue towards the target.
